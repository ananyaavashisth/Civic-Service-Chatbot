# Civic Service Chatbot (NDMC-Themed)

A personal AI chatbot project built during my internship, themed around NDMC services. It helps simulate how a local government assistant might respond to citizen queries about sanitation, complaints, and general services. No official NDMC data was usedâ€”mock datasets were created for demonstration.

## Features
- Natural language interface for mock civic queries
- LangChain agent powered by Ollama (LLM)
- Simple and interactive Streamlit UI
- Uses synthetic data for realistic interactions
